## Introduction
This is a code repository for my COVID-19 tracker website. A fully reponsive SPA that displays the total cases of COVID for every country. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Chart.js.

Notable Features:

-   Fully responsive custom css styling
-   Search modal that allows users to select a country to view
-   Containers that show the data of total cases, total recovered, and total deaths from COVID-19
-   Displays daily increase of cases

Featured ideas to implement:

- Ability to see the global statistics of COVID
- Dark mode function
